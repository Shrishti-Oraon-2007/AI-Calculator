# AI-Calculator

This Java code provides a pro2 class with an ask method that interacts with the OpenRouter AI API. It's designed to act as a strict math tutor, using the "google/gemma-3n-e2b-it:free" model. The ask method sends a user's question to the API and retrieves a response, enforcing a rule that only math-related questions will be answered; otherwise, it replies with "It is beyond my scope!"
